3/15 Poean: I'm going to create the input.txt file
3/15 Poean: Created a barebone main.c file that is supposed to open a file from the command line
3/16 Poean: main.c file now opens file from command line and puts its values into one big array 
3/17 Poean: main.c prints out all values in the array in a 9 x 9 square format like it's shown in the input file. 
            Note: the array is weird bc the 81st term is a really big number, and it's not supposed to be that way.
3/18 Poean: main.c file now takes in the thread option value. Also there is a partially created function for looking at the sudoku board vertically. Currently
            figuring out how to check each column
